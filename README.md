# CryptoClustering

This challenge involves the use of Python and knowledge of unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.  Additional tools used for this analysis include pandas, hvPlot, and scikit-learn

The use of K-means between the original scaled data set and the optimized set created with principal component analysis (PCA) in this exercise provides a means to show the possibility and efficacy of being able to use PCA data and maintain the similar end results.
